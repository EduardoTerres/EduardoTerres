## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a dedicated mathematician and software engineer, now specializing in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## âœ¨ Featured projects
Some of the key contributions that cover the whole spectrum of what I do are:

- *Researched* the intersection of neural networks and finite element methods in the following paper [Can Neural Networks learn Finite Elements?](https://github.com/EduardoTerres/Can-Neural-Networks-learn-Finite-Elements).
- Contributed to the *open source Machine Learning* project [Scikit-FDA](https://github.com/GAA-UAM/scikit-fda) by implementing, among others, a non-linear dimensionality reduction method for functional data. I created a pages [website]( https://eduardoterres.github.io/Functional-Diffusion-Maps/) with an overview on how the method works.
- Worked on other *programming projects*, like developing [Ad Astra C videogame](https://github.com/EduardoTerres/Ad-Astra-C-videogame) or [Crypto mining simulator](https://github.com/EduardoTerres/Mining-simulator) with a group of friends.
